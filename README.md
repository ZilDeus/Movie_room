# MOVIE_ROOM
Made in less than 48 hours for the HurryUp Hackathon 2024 held in Iraq, with the help of Ibrahim whatever the rest of his name is.
It's my belief that no one will read this, but here goes nothing. 
I had a lot of fun, and I'm definitely signing up again next year (and hopefully getting accepted).
The project is missing the whole syncronization part. We only focused on authentication, which was wrong of me to allow it since I was the slightly more experienced developer.
but I didn't have any experience with anything real-time, so I thought I would just knock out the easy things first. Boy, was I wrong for doing that.
It turns out we didn't have enough time to do any of the big stuff because we were focused on Auth. 
I will definitely be rewriting this and doing the backend myself this time.

project-building stuff below
# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
